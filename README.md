## Task 1: EDA and Visualization of a Real-World Dataset

### Dataset Used:

* **Titanic Dataset**

### Steps:

1. **Load the Dataset**: The Titanic dataset was loaded using Pandas, and initial exploration was done to understand its structure and key variables.
2. **Data Cleaning**:

   * Missing values were handled using imputation (mean, median) or removal, depending on the context.
   * Duplicates were removed.
   * Outliers were detected and managed using statistical methods and visualizations (boxplots, scatter plots).
3. **Visualizations**:

   * Bar charts for categorical variables.
   * Histograms for numeric feature distributions.
   * A correlation heatmap to visualize relationships between numeric features.
4. **Insights**:

   * **Gender and Survival Rates**: Women had a higher survival rate compared to men.
   * **Age Distribution**: The majority of passengers were between 20 and 40 years old.
   * **Class vs Fare**: First-class passengers paid significantly more on average than third-class passengers.

### Notebooks and Scripts:

* `task1_EDA_and_Visualization.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the EDA, visualizations, and data cleaning steps.

## Task 2: Text Sentiment Analysis

### Dataset Used:

* **IMDB Reviews Dataset**

### Steps:

1. **Text Preprocessing**:

   * Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization were performed to preprocess the text data.
2. **Feature Engineering**:

   * TF-IDF was used to convert the text data into numerical format.
3. **Model Training**:

   * A Logistic Regression model was trained to classify the sentiment (positive or negative).
4. **Model Evaluation**:

   * The model was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

### Notebooks and Scripts:

* `task2_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete process of text preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Task 3: Fraud Detection System

### Dataset Used:

* **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset**

### Steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   * Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) or undersampling were used to handle imbalanced data.
2. **Model Training**:

   * A Random Forest classifier or Gradient Boosting model was trained to detect fraudulent transactions.
3. **Model Evaluation**:

   * The system's performance was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Testing Interface**:

   * A simple command-line interface was created for testing the fraud detection system.

### Notebooks and Scripts:

* `task3_Fraud_Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the steps for fraud detection system implementation and evaluation.

## Task 4: Predicting House Prices Using the Boston Housing Dataset

### Dataset Used:

* **Boston Housing Dataset**

### Steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   * Numerical features were normalized, and categorical variables were preprocessed as needed.
2. **Model Implementation**:

   * Custom implementations of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models were developed from scratch.
3. **Performance Comparison**:

   * The models were evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and RÂ² metrics.
4. **Feature Importance**:

   * Feature importance was visualized for tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost.

### Notebooks and Scripts:

* `task4_Predicting_House_Prices.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with model implementation, performance comparison, and feature importance visualizations.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Clone the repository**:

   * `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git`

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**:

   * To run the Jupyter Notebooks, open them in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook task1_EDA_and_Visualization.ipynb
   ```

   * Repeat for other tasks (`task2_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`, `task3_Fraud_Detection.ipynb`, `task4_Predicting_House_Prices.ipynb`).

4. **Optional**: If you wish to run Python scripts outside of the notebooks, you can simply run them via the command line:

   ```bash
   python task2_Sentiment_Analysis.py
   ```

## Observations and Insights

### Task 1: EDA and Visualization

* **Gender and Survival Rates**: Women had a higher survival rate compared to men.
* **Age Distribution**: The majority of passengers were between 20 and 40 years old.
* **Class vs Fare**: First-class passengers paid significantly more on average than third-class passengers.

### Task 2: Text Sentiment Analysis

* The Logistic Regression model achieved an **F1-score** of 0.88, indicating a strong performance in predicting sentiments.
* Certain keywords like "great" and "terrible" were significant in determining the sentiment.

### Task 3: Fraud Detection System

* The Random Forest model had a high **precision** of 0.97 for detecting fraudulent transactions.
* SMOTE technique improved the recall significantly, addressing the class imbalance problem.

### Task 4: Predicting House Prices

* Random Forest and XGBoost had lower RMSE compared to Linear Regression, indicating better predictive accuracy.
* **Feature Importance**: The most important features for predicting house prices were `CRIM`, `RM`, and `AGE`.
